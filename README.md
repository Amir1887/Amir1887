- 👋 Hi, I’m Amir
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development(with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React JS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase, Git, and GitHub. I’ve built a full-stack online learning platform, which you can check out on my GitHub)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced backend technologies and cloud solutions to enhance my full-stack development skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tech-driven projects related to disaster management, education, and medical technology.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find my projects on GitHub at https://github.com/Amir1887 or email me at [amiradel1234567@gmail.com] or [amir-a-gad@students.kasralainy.edu.eg].
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact:I graduated from the faculty of medicine. My passion for programming, however, began before that, and since then I’ve fully transitioned into development..
